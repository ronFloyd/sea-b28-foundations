# My Awesome README
### by Ron Floyd

#### A Brief History

I am originally from San Luis Obispo, CA, but I've lived in Portland since 2002. Before moving up here, I served as a mechanic aboard a submarine. After the Navy, I earned a BA in Philosophy from Humboldt State University.

I started flying helicopters in 2005 and became a flight instructor in 2006. When my kids were born, I stopped flying and went to work for JetBlue Airways as an airport agent at PDX, where I worked for the last six years. After taking some CS classes at PCC and discovering how much I enjoy programming, I decided it was time for a career change, so here I am!
